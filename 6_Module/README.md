How do I use scrapy? Explain with a simple example.

Update the above code to use BeautifulSoap for parsing.

I want the parser to ignore any multimedia such as images, videos and audio . It should save the content converted from html to text into file whose name is the hash of the url being parsed.



can you write the code to scrape `https://huggingface.co/docs/peft` using the steps you outlines above?

 Please output the code for achieving this

can you use beautifulSoup for doing the parsing and making appropriate changes to the code above?

please format the above code properly


Use the following pieces of context given in to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. Keep the answer short and succinct.

Context:"""You now understand that PyTorch adds hooks to the forward and backward method of your PyTorch model when training in a distributed setup. But how does this risk slowing down your code?

In DDP (distributed data parallel), the specific order in which processes are performed and ran are expected at specific points and these must also occur at roughly the same time before moving on.

The most direct example is when you update model parameters through optimizer.step(). Without gradient accumulation, all instances of the model need to have updated their gradients computed, collated, and updated before moving on to the next batch of data. When performing gradient accumulation, you accumulate n loss gradients and skip optimizer.step() until n batches have been reached. As all training processes only need to sychronize by the time optimizer.step() is called, without any modification to your training step, this neededless inter-process communication can cause a significant slowdown.

How can you avoid this overhead?"""
